Water melon detection using OpenCV and Tensor Flow

Initial web scraping has yielded approximately 1150+ images of watermelons, available for training and testing. Also available are 2000+ images of fields, crops, and similar images for training purposes. These zipped folders can be found at http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~feaston/ as they are too large for Github to hold. The watermelons are in the Zippedmelons.zip, and the other images are in the Other.zip.
