This folder contains approximately 1,300 images of watermelons. These images will likely be used in the training of the neural net, as well as for testing purposes.
Feel free to add your own, or download this entire folder for yourself.
Many of these images were scraped from Google Images, but many also came from Image Net.
There may be a few minor mistakes, but as a large set of data, it's probably a solid start.
